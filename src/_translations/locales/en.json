The photo was taken at a running event called the '10 miles of Antwerp'. Aside from that I also do road / gravel cycling, badminton and in the winter I like to ski. Every month there is indoor football with some brothers. It is so wonderful to do all of this with my brothers and sister!",

It is so wonderful to see how Jehovah is blessing us with all the brothers and sisters around the world.\n\nI'm grateful for the opportunity to serve Jehovah and to be part of this wonderful family. And meeting you at the special convention in Belgium. We love you! Give our love to the brothers and sisters in your congregation!\n\nBrent",
